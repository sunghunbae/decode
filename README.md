## DNA encoding file format (-e filename or --encoding=filename)

A text file with single or multiple lines describes a DNA sequence design encoding building blocks and a random sequence.

### Syntax

- {#}: Sequence of # bases encoding a building block. The building block numbers 1, 2, ... are assigned sequentially from the 5' end.
- (#): Sequence of # bases encoding a random sequence to test if hit count is biased by PCR amplification.

### Example (encoding.txt)

```
AAATCGATGTG
{6}GAG
{6}AGT
{6}CGA
ACTGAATCTACT
(12)
TCAGACAAGCTTCACCTGC
```

is equivalent to

```
AAATCGATGTG{6}GAG{6}AGT{6}CGAACTGAATCTACT(12)TCAGACAAGCTTCACCTGC
```

Both of above example files describe an identical DNA encoding scheme in which 3 building blocks of 6 bases and a random sequence of 12 bases are placed between defined constant DNA sequence blocks(i.e. opening, cycle, closing, terminal tag sequences). NGS sequences are to be aligned with the encoding scheme. For instance, the following sequence satisfies the above encoding scheme. Note that additional
sequences before 5' end or after 3' end also satisfy the above encoding scheme. But a single nucleotide 
difference inside the scheme results in mismatch.

## Building block data file format (-b filename or --bbseq=filename)

### Example (BBS.txt)

```
GCTGCC FAa-001 1 10K DEL
GCTTGC FAa-002 1 10K DEL
GCTGAC FAa-003 1 10K DEL
GCTGAG FAa-004 1 10K DEL
GCTTTC FAa-005 1 10K DEL
......
```

- Column 1: Sequence tag for a building block
- Column 2: Name or molecule code for a building block
- Column 3: Building cycle number. A same building block can be used with different sequence tags for different building cycles.
- Column 4 and the following columns may contain extra information not used in the program.

## FASTQ file format

In FASTQ format, each record has four lines and the second line contains the DNA sequence.

### Example (testlg.fastq)

## Troubleshooting or rescuing unsuccessful matches (`--partly` or `-y` option)

During building a DNA encoded library, DNA sequence tag is appended as new building blocks are added to a starting scaffold.
These stepwise DNA ligations may introduce a sequence mismatch at certain step and DNA sequence up to that step may be 
still usable by modifying the encoding file (truncating the 3' part from that step). 
Using `-y` or `--partly` option turns on testing and reporting of stepwise matching.
For example, if the encoding has three building blocks and one random sequence block, it would test partial matching of sequences
in the order of bb1-bb2-bb3-rnd, bb1-bb2-bb3, bb1-bb2, bb1 until it finds the longest match.

In the above log file, the first partly matched sequence match up to three building blocks and
the second partly matched sequence match up to three building blocks and randome sequence block but fail to match the closing sequence at the very 3' end. We can rescue partly mismatched sequences
by excluding the closing sequence and/or random sequence blocks:
scheme= AAATCGATGTG{6}GAG{6}AGT{6}CGAACTGAATCTACT(12) or AAATCGATGTG{6}GAG{6}AGT{6}CGA)


## Use multiple FASTQ files for comparing different datasets

A sequencing dataset of a target can be compared with a control dataset without the target protein, 
or multiple sequencing datasets of different targets can be compared.
The first FASTQ file is used to sort building blocks and the rest of the FASTQ files are compared
with this first FASTQ file.

```
python ../decode.py -e encoding.txt -b BBS.txt -r ../data/testlg.fastq.gz ../data/testsm.fastq.gz
```
