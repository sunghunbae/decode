# decode
Decode and analyze NGS(next generation sequencing) data from DNA-Encoded Library screening 

## How to use
<pre>
Usage: decode.py [options]

Options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PREFIX, --prefix=PREFIX
                        output filename prefix
  -e ENCODING, --encoding=ENCODING
                        input encoding scheme file
  -b BBS, --bbseq=BBS   input building block sequence file
  -r, --revcomp         option for reverse complementary trial
</pre>

## DNA encoding file format
A text file with single or multiple lines describes a DNA sequence design encoding building blocks and a random sequence.

* {#} - sequence of # bases encoding a building block. The building block numbers 1, 2, ... are assigned sequentially from the 5' end.
* (#) - sequence of # bases encoding a random sequence to test if hit count is biased by PCR amplification.

<pre>
AAATCGATGTG
{6}GAG
{6}AGT
{6}CGA
ACTGAATCTACT
(12)
TCAGACAAGCTTCACCTGC
</pre>

is equivalent to

<pre>AAATCGATGTG{6}GAG{6}AGT{6}CGAACTGAATCTACT(12)TCAGACAAGCTTCACCTGC</pre>

Both of above example files describe an identical DNA encoding scheme in which 3 building blocks of 6 bases and a random sequence of 12 bases are placed between defined constant DNA sequence blocks(i.e. opening, cycle, closing, terminal tag sequences). Sequences surounding the {} or () blocks should match with the NGS data, but not necessarily from the very end of sequence. For example, the following sequence satisfies the above encoding scheme.

- Line 1: FASTA format data file containing NGS data
- Line 2: minimum allowed length of FASTA sequence
Sequences shorter than this length are ignored.
- Line 3: number of building blocks for cycle 1, 2, 3, and 4
- Line 4: output format. Counts are reported for a combination of two building blocks. Other options are 3BB and 4BB. 
- Line 5: maximum allowed mismatches. Sequences with more mismatches are not counted.
- Line 6-: DNA encoding scheme. 
-- Column 1: x, y, z, and $ are reserved for the building block sequences. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are reserved for constant sequence block.
-- Column 2: start position(number, note: the number starts from 1)
-- Column 3: end position(number)
-- Column 4: filename if 1st column is x, y, z or $ and constant sequence if that is 1-5. 

### bb1.txt - building block information

bb2.txt and bb3.txt are similar files for the 2nd and 3rd building blocks.
